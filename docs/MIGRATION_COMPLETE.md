## Migration Decision Framework

### When These Tools Make Sense
- You have repetitive, high-volume tasks
- Manual data entry consumes significant time
- Basic template responses could help
- You have €150-500/month budget available
- You can dedicate 2-6 weeks for implementation

### When to Look Elsewhere
- You need complex problem-solving automation
- Your processes require significant human judgment
