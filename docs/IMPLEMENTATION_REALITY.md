---

## Phase 1: Pre-Implementation Assessment (2-4 Weeks)

### Week 1: Business Process Audit

**What You're Actually Doing**:
- Document current manual processes with time tracking
- Identify repetitive tasks that consume more than 2 hours/week
- List existing software and systems
- Calculate current staff costs for target processes

**Tools You'll Need**:
- Stopwatch or time tracking app
- Spreadsheet for process documentation
- Staff interviews and workflow observations

**Reality Check Questions**:
- Are you trying to automate complex decision-making? (Don't)
- Do these processes require human judgment? (Keep human involvement)
- Is this task done less than 10 times per month? (Not worth automating)
- Does the current process work well enough? (Maybe just leave it)

**Expected Outcome**: Clear documentation of 3-5 processes that might benefit from automation, with time costs and complexity assessments.

### Week 2: Technical Readiness Assessment

**What You're Evaluating**:
- Do you have someone comfortable with basic IT tasks?
- Is your internet connection reliable enough for cloud tools?
- Are your current systems capable of integration?
- What's your real budget for setup and monthly costs?

**Technical Requirements Check**:
```
✓ Basic computer skills in your team
✓ Reliable internet (minimum 25 Mbps)
✓ Budget of €150-500/month for 12+ months
✓ 20-40 hours available for setup and training
✓ Willingness to maintain manual backups
```

**Red Flags to Watch For**:
- No technical person on team or available for consultation
- Expecting "set it and forget it" automation
- Budget under €100/month (insufficient for meaningful automation)
- Timeline pressure ("need it working by next week")
- Staff resistance to learning new systems

### Week 3: Vendor Research and Reality Testing

**How to Evaluate Vendors Honestly**:
1. **Ask for actual customer references** (not testimonials)
2. **Request detailed cost breakdown** including all hidden fees
3. **Demand realistic timeline** with contingencies
4. **Test their support responsiveness** before purchasing
5. **Get specific capabilities documentation** not marketing materials

**Questions That Reveal Truth**:
- "What percentage of your customers actually achieve the promised savings?"
- "What's your typical implementation timeline when things go wrong?"
- "Can I speak with a customer who had implementation challenges?"
- "What happens if our staff can't learn the system effectively?"
- "What are the real monthly costs including all add-ons?"

### Week 4: Go/No-Go Decision Framework

**Proceed Only If**:
- Realistic cost-benefit analysis shows break-even within 18 months
- You have technical support available (internal or contracted)
- Staff are willing to learn new systems
- Manual backup processes can be maintained
- Vendor provides honest references and realistic timelines

**DON'T Proceed If**:
- Promises seem too good to be true
- Vendor won't provide references or detailed costs
- Your budget is tight (automation requires ongoing investment)
- Staff are resistant to change
- Current processes work adequately

## When NOT to Implement These Tools

### Business Situations Where Automation Fails

#### 1. Highly Variable Processes
**Example**: Creative agencies where each project is unique
**Why automation fails**: Can't standardize what's intentionally different
**Better solution**: Project management tools, creative software upgrades

#### 2. Heavy Regulation Requirements
**Example**: Financial services with complex compliance needs
**Why automation fails**: Liability and audit requirements need human oversight
**Better solution**: Compliance software, professional services, staff training

#### 3. Personal Relationship-Dependent Business
**Example**: High-end consultancy, luxury services, counseling
**Why automation fails**: Customers pay for human expertise and connection
**Better solution**: CRM for organization, but keep human interaction central

#### 4. Extremely Low Volume Operations
**Example**: Less than 10 transactions per day
**Why automation fails**: Setup costs exceed time savings
**Better solution**: Improve manual processes, use simple software tools

#### 5. Seasonal or Irregular Business
**Example**: Tax preparation, event planning, seasonal retail
**Why automation fails**: Complex systems idle most of the year
**Better solution**: Hire temporary help, use existing seasonal software

### Staff and Cultural Factors

#### Red Flag Indicators:
- **"We've always done it this way"** - Strong resistance to change
- **High staff turnover** - New people won't learn complex systems
- **Very small team** (<3 people) - Everyone needs to do everything
- **Owner not tech-savvy** - Can't provide ongoing support and leadership
- **Crisis management culture** - Always fighting fires, no time for process improvement

### Financial Situations Where It's Not Worth It

#### Budget Reality Check:
```
If your annual revenue is under €100,000:
→ Focus on growing revenue, not automating costs

If staff costs are under €50,000/year total:
→ Efficiency gains won't cover automation costs

If you can't afford €5,000 loss without impact:
→ Too risky for experimental automation

If monthly cash flow is unpredictable:
→ Can't sustain ongoing automation costs
```
