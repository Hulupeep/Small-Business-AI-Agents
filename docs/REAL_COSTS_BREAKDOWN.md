## 💡 Ways to Reduce Costs

### Smart API Usage
```python
# Cache frequent queries
cache = {}

def get_ai_response(query):
    # Check cache first (saves 40-60% on API costs)
    cache_key = hash(query)
    if cache_key in cache:
        return cache[cache_key]

    # Use cheaper model for simple queries
    if is_simple_query(query):
        model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"  # €0.002 vs €0.03 for GPT-4
    else:
        model = "gpt-4"

    response = openai.chat.completions.create(model=model, ...)
    cache[cache_key] = response
    return response
```

### Hybrid Approach
- **Rule-based for common queries** (80% of volume)
- **AI for complex queries** (20% of volume)
- **Result**: 60-70% cost reduction

### Progressive Implementation
1. **Phase 1**: Single use case (€2-5k)
2. **Phase 2**: Expand if successful (€5-10k)
3. **Phase 3**: Full implementation (€10-20k)
4. **Result**: Reduced risk, proven ROI
