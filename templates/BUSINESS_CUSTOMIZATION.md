Total Value = Lead Value + Brand Value + Retention Value - Agent Cost

Example:
- Generated 25 leads/month from content
- 20% conversion rate = 5 sales
- $3,000 average sale = $15,000 revenue
- Brand awareness value: $2,000/month
- Customer retention value: $1,000/month
- Agent cost: $700/month
- Monthly Value: $15,000 + $2,000 + $1,000 - $700 = $17,300
- ROI = ($17,300 √∑ $700) √ó 100 = 2,471%

### Success Metrics to Track

| Metric | What to Measure | Good Performance |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Referral Quantity** | Number of referrals received monthly | Varies by business |
| **Referral Quality** | % of referrals that meet ideal criteria | 70%+ |
| **Conversion Rate** | % of referrals that become customers | 40-60% |
| **Referrer Satisfaction** | How happy referrers are with the process | 9+ out of 10 |
| **Program ROI** | Revenue from referrals vs program costs | 5x+ return |

### ROI Calculation

**Referral Agent Value Formula:**
```
Referral Revenue = (Referrals Generated √ó Conversion Rate √ó Average Sale Value)
Program Costs = (Referral Rewards + Agent Cost + Marketing Materials)
Referral Value = (Referral Revenue √ó Higher LTV) - Program Costs
ROI = (Referral Value √∑ Program Costs) √ó 100

Example:
- Generated 20 referrals/month
- 50% conversion rate = 10 new customers
- $6,000 average sale = $60,000 revenue
- Referral rewards: $2,000/month
- Agent cost: $800/month
- Total program cost: $2,800/month
- Referrals have 2x higher LTV = $120,000 total value
- Net Value: $120,000 - $2,800 = $117,200
- ROI = ($117,200 √∑ $2,800) √ó 100 = 4,186%

## üí∞ Business-Specific ROI Calculations

### Service-Based Businesses
```
Focus on: Customer acquisition cost, lifetime value, referral rates
Key Formula: (New Customers √ó LTV √ó Referral Multiplier) - Total Costs

Example: Law Firm
- 5 new clients/month from agents
- $10,000 average client value
- 50% refer additional clients = 1.5x multiplier
- Revenue: 5 √ó $10,000 √ó 1.5 = $75,000
- Agent costs: $3,000/month
- ROI: ($75,000 - $3,000) √∑ $3,000 √ó 100 = 2,400%
```

### Product-Based Businesses
```
Focus on: Sales volume, average order value, repeat purchase rate
Key Formula: (Orders √ó AOV √ó Repeat Rate) - (Product Costs + Agent Costs)

Example: E-commerce Store
- 200 orders/month from agents
- $120 average order value
- 40% repeat purchase rate
- Revenue: 200 √ó $120 √ó 1.4 = $33,600
- Product costs (60%): $20,160
- Agent costs: $2,500/month
- Profit: $33,600 - $20,160 - $2,500 = $10,940
- ROI: ($10,940 √∑ $2,500) √ó 100 = 438%
```

### SaaS/Subscription Businesses
```
Focus on: Monthly recurring revenue, churn rate, upgrade rate
Key Formula: (New MRR + Expansion MRR - Churn Prevented) √ó 12 - Annual Agent Cost

Example: Software Company
- $15,000 new MRR/month from agents
- $5,000 expansion MRR from upsells
- $8,000 churn prevented
- Annual value: ($15,000 + $5,000 + $8,000) √ó 12 = $336,000
- Annual agent costs: $18,000
- ROI: ($336,000 - $18,000) √∑ $18,000 √ó 100 = 1,767%
