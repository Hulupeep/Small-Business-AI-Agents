## üÜò Common Issues & Fixes

### "Bot doesn't understand questions"
Add more keyword variations:
```javascript
if (lowerMessage.includes('hour') ||
    lowerMessage.includes('open') ||
    lowerMessage.includes('closed') ||
    lowerMessage.includes('time')) {
    return businessInfo.faqs.hours;
}
```

### "Responses are too generic"
Make them specific:
```javascript
faqs: {
    "appointment": "Yes! Book online at [URL] or call us at (555) 0123. We usually have same-week availability.",
}
```

### "Not working on mobile"
Ensure responsive CSS:
```css
@media (max-width: 480px) {
    #chat-widget {
        width: 90%;
        height: 80vh;
    }
}
```
