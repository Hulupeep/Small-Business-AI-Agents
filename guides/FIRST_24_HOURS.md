Give me:

```

### Step 3: Add YOUR Specific Information (15 minutes)
When Claude gives you the code, you'll see placeholders. Replace them:

**Example for a Pizza Restaurant:**
```javascript
// Claude will give you code like this:
const businessInfo = {
  name: "Mario's Pizza",  // <- Put YOUR business name
  hours: "Mon-Sat 11am-10pm, Sun 12pm-9pm",  // <- YOUR hours
  phone: "555-0123",  // <- YOUR phone
  address: "123 Main St, Boston",  // <- YOUR address
  delivery: "Yes, $3 fee, 5 mile radius",  // <- YOUR delivery info

  menu: {
    "Pizza": {

    "Do you deliver?": "Yes, we deliver within 5 miles for a $3 fee",
    "Are you open now?": "We're open Mon-Sat 11am-10pm, Sun 12pm-9pm",
    "Do you have gluten-free?": "Yes, we offer gluten-free crust for $3 extra",
    "How long for delivery?": "Usually 30-45 minutes",
    "Do you cater?": "Yes! Call us for catering orders over 5 pizzas"
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Test It With Real Questions (20 minutes)
Ask the AI your actual customer questions:
- "What time do you open?"
- "How much is delivery?"
- "Do you have [specific product]?"
- "Can I book a table for tonight?"

## üÜò Stuck? Here's Help:

My business is a dog grooming salon in Denver.
We're open Tue-Sat 9-5.
Services: Bath $30, Full groom $60, Nail trim $15
We don't handle cats or aggressive dogs.
We book 2 weeks out usually.
```

### "It's not working on my website"
Try this simpler approach:
1. Use a service like Tidio or Intercom
2. Paste your AI responses there
3. They handle the technical parts

### "I don't have time for 24 hours"
Start with just ONE agent:
- Customer service if you get lots of questions
