## Common Integration Code

### For Developers - Python Example
```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MimeText
from email.mime.multipart import MimeMultipart

def send_email(smtp_server, port, username, password, to_email, subject, body):
    # Create message
    msg = MimeMultipart()
    msg['From'] = username
    msg['To'] = to_email
    msg['Subject'] = subject

    # Add body to email
    msg.attach(MimeText(body, 'plain'))

    # Create SMTP session
    server = smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, port)
    server.starttls()  # Enable TLS encryption
    server.login(username, password)

    # Send email
    text = msg.as_string()
    server.sendmail(username, to_email, text)
    server.quit()

# Example usage
send_email(
    smtp_server="smtp.gmail.com",
    port=587,
    username="your-email@gmail.com",
    password="your-app-password",
    to_email="recipient@example.com",
    subject="Test from LangChain",
    body="This is a test email!"
)
```

### For No-Code Tools (Zapier, Make.com, etc.)
**Copy these exact settings:**
- **Server**: smtp.gmail.com (or appropriate server from above)
- **Port**: 587
- **Username**: your full email address
- **Password**: your app password (NOT your regular password)
- **Authentication**: Login/Plain
- **Encryption**: TLS/STARTTLS
