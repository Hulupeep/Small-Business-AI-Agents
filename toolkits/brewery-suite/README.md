## üç∫ PERSONA: PADDY COLLINS - COLLINS CRAFT BREWERY

**Background:** Paddy founded Collins Craft Brewery in Kilkenny 6 years ago, producing small-batch Irish ales and seasonal specials. His "Collins IPA" won bronze at the Irish Beer Awards, but business growth is hampered by operational chaos.

- **Missed Sales Opportunities:** ‚Ç¨4,000/month lost in merchandise and online sales
- **Stock Management:** Distributors don't update availability, disappointed customers

**Brewery Frustrations:**
- **Weekend Chaos:** Taproom overwhelmed while tours interfere with production
- **Marketing Scattered:** Social media sporadic, no customer database
- **Seasonal Struggles:** Winter slump due to poor customer retention
- **Distribution Headaches:** Manual updates to 40+ stockists across Ireland

**Financial Impact:**
- **Lost Tour Revenue:** ‚Ç¨2,000/month from poor booking management
- **Merchandise Misses:** ‚Ç¨1,500/month from limited online presence
