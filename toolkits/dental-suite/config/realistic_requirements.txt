# Cost Estimates (Monthly):
# - OpenAI API: €25-40 (moderate usage)
# - Twilio SMS: €20-40 (200-800 SMS/month)
# - SendGrid Email: €10-25 (up to 100k emails)
# - Google Workspace (optional): €6/user/month
# - Total API costs: €61-111/month for typical small practice

# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# 1. Not all packages are required - choose based on your needs
# 2. SQLite is sufficient for practices with <1000 active patients
# 3. Google Calendar integration requires Google Workspace account
# 4. SMS costs vary significantly based on volume
# 5. Consider using practice management system APIs instead of building from scratch
