## Diagnostic Intake Agent Conversations

### **Conversation 1: Brake Noise Inquiry**
```
🔧 O'Connor's Auto Repair - Diagnostic Intake

[Phone rings at 10:23 AM]

AI Agent: "Good morning! You've reached O'Connor's Auto Repair. I'm the diagnostic assistant. How can I help with your vehicle today?"

Customer: "Hi, um, my car is making this really bad grinding noise when I brake. I'm kind of worried about it."

AI Agent: "I understand your concern - brake noises are definitely something we take seriously. Can you tell me a bit more? When you press the brake pedal, does the grinding happen every time, or only sometimes?"

Customer: "Every single time I brake. It's gotten worse over the past week."

AI Agent: "That's helpful information. A few more questions to help me understand: Do you feel any vibration in the steering wheel when you brake? And roughly how many kilometers have you driven since your last brake service?"

Customer: "No vibration, but I honestly can't remember when I last had the brakes done. Maybe two years ago?"

AI Agent: "Thank you. Based on what you're describing - grinding noise every time you brake, getting progressively worse, no vibration - this sounds like your brake pads have worn down to the metal backing. This is a safety concern that should be addressed within the next few days."

Customer: "Oh no, how much is that going to cost?"

AI Agent: "For brake pad replacement, depending on your vehicle, it typically runs between €280 and €350, including labor. Could you tell me what year and model car you're driving?"

Customer: "It's a 2018 Honda Civic."

AI Agent: "Perfect. For your 2018 Civic, brake pad replacement would be around €285 to €320. I can schedule you for a brake inspection and service. We have availability Thursday at 2 PM or Friday at 11 AM. Which works better for you?"

Customer: "Thursday at 2 sounds good. Will you need the car for long?"

AI Agent: "Brake service typically takes about 2 hours. We'll call you if we find anything additional that needs attention, but we'll always get your approval before doing any extra work. Can I get your name and phone number to confirm this appointment?"

Customer: "Sarah Johnson, and my number is 087-123-4567."

AI Agent: "Excellent, Sarah. I have you scheduled for Thursday, October 17th at 2 PM for brake inspection and service on your 2018 Honda Civic. We're located at 123 Main Street in Dublin. Is there anything else I can help you with today?"

Customer: "No, that's perfect. Thank you!"

AI Agent: "You're welcome, Sarah. Just to be safe, please drive carefully until Thursday - give yourself extra stopping distance. We'll see you at 2 PM on Thursday. Have a great day!"

[Call ends - Duration: 4 minutes, 32 seconds]

### **Conversation 2: Engine Problem**
```
🔧 O'Connor's Auto Repair - Diagnostic Intake

[Phone rings at 2:45 PM]

AI Agent: "Good afternoon! O'Connor's Auto Repair, diagnostic assistant speaking. How can I help you today?"

Customer: "Hi there. My car's been running really rough lately, especially when it's idling. It feels like it's going to stall."

AI Agent: "That must be frustrating. Rough idling can have several causes, but I can help narrow it down. When did you first notice this - was it sudden or has it been getting gradually worse?"

Customer: "It started about two weeks ago, just a little bit, but now it's really bad. Sometimes it actually does stall at traffic lights."

AI Agent: "I see. That's definitely something we need to look at. A couple more questions: Does this happen when the engine is cold, warm, or both? And have you noticed any warning lights on your dashboard?"

Customer: "Both cold and warm, but it seems worse when it's cold. And yes, the check engine light came on yesterday."

AI Agent: "Thank you for that information. With rough idling that's getting progressively worse, plus a check engine light, this could be related to spark plugs, air filter, or fuel system components. The good news is these are typically straightforward repairs."

Customer: "What kind of cost are we looking at?"

AI Agent: "It depends on what our diagnostic reveals, but common fixes for these symptoms range from €150 to €400. The diagnostic itself is €85, and that gets applied to the repair cost if you proceed. What type of vehicle are we working with?"

Customer: "It's a 2017 Ford Focus, 1.6 liter engine."

AI Agent: "Perfect. For your Focus, if it's spark plugs, that would be around €180. If it's the air filter, about €45. Fuel system cleaning runs around €150. We won't know for sure until we run the diagnostic, but I can schedule you for tomorrow morning if this is urgent?"

Customer: "Yes, I'd like to get it looked at soon. What times do you have?"

AI Agent: "I can fit you in tomorrow at 9 AM or 10:30 AM. The diagnostic usually takes about an hour, and if it's something simple like spark plugs, we could have you back on the road by lunch time."

Customer: "9 AM works great. Do I need to bring anything?"

AI Agent: "Just bring your keys and any paperwork if you have recent service records. Could I get your name and contact number for the appointment?"

Customer: "John Murphy, 085-987-6543."

AI Agent: "Excellent, John. I have you scheduled for tomorrow, October 16th at 9 AM for engine diagnostic on your 2017 Ford Focus. We'll run the diagnostic, give you a detailed explanation of what we find, and a quote for any necessary repairs. Sound good?"

Customer: "Perfect, thank you so much."

AI Agent: "You're welcome, John. If the car stalls while driving, try to restart it right away - most of these issues don't leave you completely stranded. See you at 9 AM tomorrow!"

[Call ends - Duration: 3 minutes, 18 seconds]

📊 CALL ANALYSIS:
✅ Issue identified: Engine rough idle + check engine light
✅ Possible causes identified: Spark plugs, air filter, fuel system
✅ Diagnostic scheduled: Tomorrow 9 AM
✅ Cost expectations set: €150-€400 range
✅ Customer reassured: Won't be stranded
