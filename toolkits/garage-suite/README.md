## Who You Are

You're **Mike O'Connor**, owner of **O'Connor's Auto Repair**, a trusted local garage with 3 mechanics. You handle 20+ vehicles daily - from quick oil changes to complex engine rebuilds. You built your reputation on quality work and fair pricing, but you're watching customers slip away to quick-lube chains and chain stores because you can't compete on convenience and communication.

Your shop has character - the coffee pot that's been brewing since 1987, hand-drawn service diagrams on the whiteboard, and loyal customers who've trusted you for decades. But your handwritten job cards are getting grease-stained, your phone rings unanswered while you're under a car, and customers are increasingly frustrated by the "black box" nature of automotive repairs.

You know cars inside and out, but you're drowning in administrative tasks, missed communications, and the constant struggle to explain why a "simple" brake job costs ‚Ç¨400.

## Your Pain Points

- üîß **Can't answer phones while working on cars** (losing 30% of incoming calls)
- üí∏ **Customers shocked by repair costs** with no context or explanation beforehand
- üìÖ **Service reminder postcards ignored** (only 15% return rate)
- üöó **"What's that noise?" calls taking 20 minutes each** while you try to diagnose over phone
- üìù **Handwritten job cards getting lost or greasy**, leading to confusion and rework
- ‚è∞ **Parts ordering delays** because you forgot to check stock before promising completion dates
- üë• **Customers don't understand the difference** between your quality work and quick-lube services
- üìä **No visibility into which services** are due across your customer base
- üíî **Losing loyal customers** to convenience-focused competitors
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Emergency repairs disrupting** your carefully planned schedule
