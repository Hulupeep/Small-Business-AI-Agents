# 📢 Customer Communication Hub Agent

*The AI that keeps everyone informed and happy throughout the repair process*

## Overview

The Communication Hub Agent manages all customer interactions from the moment work begins until final payment. It provides real-time updates, educational content, and proactive communication to eliminate the "black box" experience that frustrates customers and generates unnecessary phone calls.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. **Real-Time Repair Status Updates**
```python
class RealTimeStatusTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.workflow_tracker = WorkflowTracker()
        self.milestone_detector = MilestoneDetector()
        self.message_generator = MessageGenerator()

    async def track_repair_progress(self, work_order_id):
        """Monitor repair progress and trigger appropriate communications"""

        work_order = await self.workflow_tracker.get_work_order(work_order_id)

        # Monitor for significant milestones
        while work_order.status != "completed":
            current_stage = await self.workflow_tracker.get_current_stage(work_order_id)

            # Check if milestone reached
            if self.milestone_detector.is_significant_milestone(current_stage):
                update_message = await self.generate_progress_update(
                    work_order=work_order,
                    current_stage=current_stage
                )

                await self.send_customer_update(
                    customer=work_order.customer,
                    message=update_message,
                    priority=current_stage.communication_priority
                )

            # Check for delays or issues
            if current_stage.is_delayed or current_stage.has_issues:
                delay_message = await self.generate_delay_notification(
                    work_order=work_order,

        🔧 BRAKE REPAIR EXPLAINED

        Think of brake pads like the erasers on pencils - they wear down
        with use. When they get too thin, they can't stop your car safely.

        We're replacing the worn pads with new ones, which will restore
        your braking power and keep you safe on the road.

        This is like putting new shoes on when the soles wear out!

        Your brake pads use friction material to convert kinetic energy
        into heat energy, slowing your vehicle. When this friction material
        wears below 3mm, stopping distances increase significantly.

        We're installing new ceramic brake pads that provide:
        • Better heat dissipation
        • Reduced brake dust
        • Quieter operation

## Sample Communication Flows

### **Flow 1: Brake Repair Progress Updates**
```
8:30 AM - Work Started:
"Hi Sarah! We've started work on your Honda Civic's brakes.
Estimated completion: 11:30 AM. We'll update you as we progress."

9:15 AM - Parts Inspection:
"Quick update: We've removed your old brake pads. As expected,
they were worn down to 2mm. Installing your new ceramic pads now."

10:45 AM - Testing Phase:
"Brake work complete! We're now doing our safety test drive
and final inspection. Should be ready in 30 minutes."

11:15 AM - Ready for Pickup:
"🎉 Your Honda Civic is ready! New brakes installed and tested.
Total: €326.57 (as quoted). Pickup anytime before 6 PM."

Next Day - Educational Follow-up:
"Hope you're enjoying the improved braking! Remember: new brake
pads may feel different for the first 200km as they break in.
This is normal. Your warranty: 2 years/40,000km."
```

### **Flow 2: Unexpected Issue Discovery**
```
10:30 AM - Issue Discovery:
"Hi John, quick update on your Ford Focus timing belt repair.
We discovered your water pump is also leaking. This is common
at your mileage (85,000km)."

10:32 AM - Options Presented:
"We can replace the water pump now while everything's apart
(saves €150 in labor) or you can wait. If it fails later,
you'd need to repeat much of the same work. What would you prefer?

Option 1: Replace now (+€185 total)
Option 2: Replace later (~€350 when it fails)

Reply 1 or 2, or call (01) 555-0123"

11:15 AM - Customer Approval:
Customer replies "1"

11:17 AM - Confirmation:
"Perfect! We'll replace the water pump too. This extends your
repair by 2 hours, but you'll have peace of mind. New completion
time: 4:30 PM. We'll update you when finished."

4:45 PM - Completion:
"John, your Ford Focus is ready! We completed:
✅ Timing belt replacement
✅ Water pump replacement
✅ Coolant system flush

Total: €822.50. Both repairs have 2-year warranty.
Your car should be good for another 100,000km!"

## Integration Requirements

### **CRM Integration**
```python
# Customer relationship management integration
class CRMIntegration:
    def __init__(self, crm_type):
        self.crm = self.initialize_crm_connector(crm_type)

    async def log_communication(self, customer_id, communication_data):
        """Log all customer communications in CRM"""

        await self.crm.activities.create({
            "customer_id": customer_id,
            "type": "communication",
            "channel": communication_data.channel,
            "direction": "outbound",
            "content": communication_data.message,
            "timestamp": communication_data.sent_at,
            "status": communication_data.delivery_status
        })

    async def update_customer_preferences(self, customer_id, preferences):
        """Update customer communication preferences"""

        await self.crm.customers.update(customer_id, {
            "preferred_communication": preferences.primary_channel,
            "communication_frequency": preferences.frequency,
            "technical_level": preferences.technical_understanding
        })
```

### **Workshop Management Integration**
```python
# Integration with garage workflow systems
class WorkshopIntegration:
    def __init__(self):
        self.workflow_api = WorkshopAPI()
        self.mechanic_tracker = MechanicTracker()

    async def get_real_time_status(self, work_order_id):
        """Get current status of work order from workshop system"""

        status = await self.workflow_api.get_work_order_status(work_order_id)

        return {
            "current_stage": status.current_operation,
            "assigned_mechanic": status.mechanic_name,
            "estimated_completion": status.eta,
            "completion_percentage": status.progress_percent,
            "any_issues": status.has_complications
        }
```

## Next Steps
