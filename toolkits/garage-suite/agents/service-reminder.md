# üìÖ Service Reminder & Scheduler Agent

*The AI that never forgets when your customers need service*

## Overview

The Service Reminder Agent tracks every vehicle's maintenance schedule, sends proactive reminders, and automatically books appointments. It transforms your passive "wait for customers to remember" approach into an active "we'll remind you" service that keeps vehicles maintained and your calendar full.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. **Automated Service Interval Tracking**
```python
# Service interval database
SERVICE_INTERVALS = {
    "oil_change": {
        "mileage_based": {
            "conventional_oil": 5000,  # km
            "synthetic_oil": 10000,    # km
            "diesel": 7500             # km
        },
        "time_based": {
            "months": 6,
            "severe_conditions": 4
        }
    },
    "brake_inspection": {
        "mileage_based": 20000,
        "time_based": {"months": 12}
    },
    "timing_belt": {
        "mileage_based": 100000,
        "time_based": {"years": 7}
    }
}
```

### 2. **Multi-Vehicle Family Management**
```python
class FamilyVehicleManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vehicle_tracker = VehicleTracker()
        self.scheduler = ServiceScheduler()

    def coordinate_family_services(self, family_id):
        """Coordinate services for all family vehicles"""

        family_vehicles = self.get_family_vehicles(family_id)

        # Find vehicles due for service
        due_services = []
        for vehicle in family_vehicles:
            services = self.check_due_services(vehicle)
            if services:
                due_services.append({
                    "vehicle": vehicle,
                    "services": services,
                    "urgency": self.calculate_urgency(services)
                })

        # Suggest combined appointment
        if len(due_services) > 1:
            return self.suggest_multi_vehicle_appointment(due_services)

        return due_services
```

### 3. **Weather-Based Recommendations**
```python
class WeatherBasedService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.weather_api = WeatherAPI()
        self.seasonal_services = SeasonalServiceDatabase()

    async def generate_seasonal_reminders(self, location, month):
        """Generate weather-appropriate service reminders"""

        weather_forecast = await self.weather_api.get_seasonal_forecast(location)

        recommendations = []

        if weather_forecast.approaching_winter:
            recommendations.extend([
                "winter_tire_changeover",
                "battery_load_test",
                "antifreeze_check",
                "heating_system_inspection"
            ])

        if weather_forecast.heavy_rain_season:
            recommendations.extend([
                "wiper_blade_replacement",
                "tire_tread_inspection",
                "brake_inspection"
            ])

        return recommendations
```

## Implementation Code

### Main Service Reminder System
```python
class ServiceReminderAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vehicle_db = VehicleDatabase()
        self.reminder_engine = ReminderEngine()
        self.scheduler = ServiceScheduler()

    async def daily_reminder_check(self):
        """Daily scan for due services and send reminders"""

        today = datetime.now()

        # Get all vehicles due for service
        due_vehicles = await self.vehicle_db.get_vehicles_due_for_service(
            check_date=today,
            lookahead_days=30
        )

        for vehicle in due_vehicles:
            reminder = await self.generate_service_reminder(vehicle)
            await self.send_reminder(reminder)

    async def generate_service_reminder(self, vehicle):
        """Generate personalized service reminder"""

        due_services = self.calculate_due_services(vehicle)
        customer = await self.vehicle_db.get_customer(vehicle.customer_id)

        reminder = ServiceReminder(
            customer=customer,
            vehicle=vehicle,
            due_services=due_services,
            preferred_contact=customer.communication_preference,
            urgency=self.calculate_reminder_urgency(due_services)
        )

        # Customize message based on customer history
        reminder.message = self.customize_reminder_message(
            customer=customer,
            services=due_services,
            vehicle=vehicle
        )

        return reminder
```

### Vehicle Tracking System
```python
class VehicleTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mileage_estimator = MileageEstimator()
        self.service_predictor = ServicePredictor()

    def update_vehicle_mileage(self, vehicle_id, current_mileage):
        """Update vehicle mileage and recalculate service dates"""

        vehicle = self.vehicle_db.get_vehicle(vehicle_id)
        previous_mileage = vehicle.last_known_mileage

        # Calculate mileage rate
        mileage_rate = self.calculate_mileage_rate(
            vehicle,
            previous_mileage,
            current_mileage
        )

        # Update predictions
        next_services = self.predict_next_service_dates(
            vehicle,
            current_mileage,
            mileage_rate
        )

        # Schedule reminders
        for service in next_services:
            self.schedule_future_reminder(vehicle, service)

    def predict_next_service_dates(self, vehicle, current_mileage, mileage_rate):
        """Predict when each service will be due"""

        predictions = []

        for service_type, interval_data in SERVICE_INTERVALS.items():
            # Check last service date
            last_service = self.get_last_service(vehicle, service_type)

            # Calculate next due date
            if interval_data.get('mileage_based'):
                miles_until_due = (
                    last_service.mileage + interval_data['mileage_based']
                    - current_mileage
                )
                months_until_due = miles_until_due / (mileage_rate * 30)
            else:
                months_until_due = interval_data['time_based']['months']

            next_due_date = datetime.now() + timedelta(days=months_until_due * 30)

            predictions.append({
                'service_type': service_type,
                'due_date': next_due_date,
