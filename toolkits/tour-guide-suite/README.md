## üåä PERSONA: NIAMH MCCARTHY - GALWAY BAY TOURS

- **Language Barriers:** International visitors with varying English levels
- **Seasonal Cash Flow:** Feast or famine between summer crowds and winter silence
- **Group Management:** Mixing German tour groups with American backpackers

**Peak Season Pressures:**
- **July/August:** 200+ tourists daily, overwhelming solo operation
- **Shoulder Season:** Need to maximize every opportunity
- **Winter:** Maintain engagement for spring bookings

**Financial Impact:**
- **Weather Cancellations:** ‚Ç¨15,000/year in lost revenue
- **No-Shows:** ‚Ç¨30,000/year (especially international tourists)
