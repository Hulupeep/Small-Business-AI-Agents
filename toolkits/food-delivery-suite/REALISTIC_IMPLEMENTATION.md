## Common Questions

### "Will this work with [delivery platform]?"
Most major platforms (Uber Eats, Deliveroo, Just Eat) have APIs we can connect to. Some require approval which can take 2-4 weeks.

### "What if our internet goes down?"
The system includes offline order backup, but delivery integrations require internet. We recommend a backup internet connection for busy restaurants.

### "Can we customize the kitchen display?"
Yes, basic customization is included. We can adjust colors, fonts, and layout to match your workflow.

## Is This Right for Your Restaurant?
