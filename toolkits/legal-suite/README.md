## THE PERSONA: SIOBHAN KELLY - SMALL SOLICITOR PRACTICE

Siobhan Kelly runs Kelly & Associates, a 3-person solicitor practice in Galway specializing in family law, wills & estates, and residential property. After 15 years building her reputation, she's drowning in operational inefficiency:

**The Daily Reality:**
- 7 AM: Check overnight emails - 3 new client inquiries mixed with 12 spam leads
- 9 AM: Spend 30 minutes explaining basic divorce process to consultation that won't retain her
- 11 AM: Realize client intake form is incomplete - missing critical financial documents
- 1 PM: Court deadline reminder buried in emails - frantically prepare filing
- 3 PM: Client calls asking same question answered in last week's letter
- 6 PM: Still billing time from scattered notes and memory

**The Pain Points:**
- **Lead Quality Crisis**: 70% of consultations don't convert - wasting 12 hours/week on unqualified prospects
- **Revenue Leakage**: â‚¬4,000/month lost on incomplete time tracking and write-offs
- **Document Chaos**: Templates scattered, intake forms incomplete, deadlines missed
- **Client Communication Overload**: Same questions asked repeatedly, updates lost in email chains
- **Compliance Anxiety**: Court deadlines, filing requirements, continuing education tracking
- **Administrative Burden**: 20 hours/week on non-billable admin work

**The Dream:**
A practice that runs like a well-oiled machine - qualified leads arrive pre-screened, documentation is complete, clients stay informed, and every billable minute is captured.
