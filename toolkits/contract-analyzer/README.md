## üí° Real Success Story: The $50,000 Save

**Business:** TechFlow SaaS (15 employees)
**Contract:** Cloud hosting agreement
**Issue:** Hidden in page 47 of 52 pages

**What the Agent Found:**
```
üî¥ RED FLAG: Unlimited Liability Clause
"Customer assumes full liability for any data breach,
regardless of cause, including breaches due to
Provider's security failures."

üí∞ FINANCIAL IMPACT:
- If their servers get hacked, YOU pay for it
- Potential cost: $50,000-500,000+ in breach response
- Industry standard: Provider should cover their own security failures

‚úÖ ACTION ITEM:
Change to: "Each party liable only for breaches caused
by their own negligence."
```

**Result:** TechFlow negotiated the change, avoided paying $50,000 when the hosting company was breached 6 months later.

## üéØ Most Dangerous Contract Clauses to Watch For

**What it sounds like:** "Contract automatically renews"
**What it means:** You're trapped paying even if you don't need the service

### 3. Broad Indemnification
**What it sounds like:** "Customer will hold vendor harmless"
**What it means:** You pay their legal bills if they get sued
**Red flag words:** "indemnify", "hold harmless", "defend against all claims"

### 4. IP Assignment Overreach
**What it sounds like:** "Work product belongs to company"
**What it means:** They own ideas you develop even outside this project
**Red flag words:** "all inventions", "derivative works", "improvements"

### 5. Data Ownership Traps

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: Analysis is too generic
**Solution:** Add more business context
```
Additional context for analysis:
- We're a 10-person marketing agency
- Most contracts are $5K-25K annual value
- We work with Fortune 500 clients
- Our biggest risk is missed deadlines causing client losses
- We can't afford liability over $50K
```

### Problem: AI missed an important clause
**Solution:** Ask specific follow-up questions
```
You missed analyzing the "Force Majeure" clause in section 12.4.
How does this protect us if we can't deliver due to circumstances
beyond our control? Is this standard language?
```

### Problem: Conflicting advice from different AI tools
**Solution:** Use the most conservative interpretation
```
I got different analyses from different AI tools. Give me the
most conservative interpretation - what's the worst-case scenario
for this clause, and how should I protect against it?
```

### Problem: Contract has unusual industry terms
**Solution:** Ask for industry context
```
This is a contract for [SPECIFIC INDUSTRY]. Are these terms
standard in this industry? What industry-specific risks should
I be aware of that might not apply to general business contracts?
```
