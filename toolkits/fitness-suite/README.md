## THE PERSONA: JAMIE WALSH - FITLIFE STUDIO OWNER

Jamie Walsh owns FitLife Studio, a boutique fitness center in Dublin with 3 trainers offering gym access, yoga, and pilates classes. What started as a passion project is now drowning in operational chaos:

**The Daily Reality:**
- 6 AM: Check overnight cancellations, frantically text members on waitlist
- 8 AM: Third no-show this week - that's â‚¬150 lost revenue
- 10 AM: ClassPass notification - another discounted booking taking a full-price member's spot
- 2 PM: Spend 45 minutes manually scheduling Sarah's maternity cover
- 4 PM: Member complains about being charged for class they cancelled (but after 12-hour deadline)
- 8 PM: Still haven't followed up with members who haven't been in for 3 weeks

**The Pain Points:**
- **Revenue Bleeding**: â‚¬2,500/month lost to no-shows and empty classes
- **ClassPass Dependency**: 40% of bookings at 50% revenue - trapped in race to bottom
- **Admin Overload**: 15 hours/week on scheduling, billing disputes, waitlist management
- **Member Churn**: 23% annual turnover - can't identify at-risk members until they cancel
- **Staff Scheduling Chaos**: Last-minute cover arrangements, overtime costs
- **No Personalization**: Members feel like numbers, not individuals

**The Dream:**
A system that runs itself - classes fill automatically, members stay engaged, trainers focus on training, and Jamie can actually go home at 6 PM.
