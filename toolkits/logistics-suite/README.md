## THE PERSONA: PAT DOYLE - DOYLE COURIERS OWNER

Pat Doyle runs Doyle Couriers, a family delivery business in Dublin with 5 drivers serving local businesses and residential customers. After 12 years building routes and relationships, operational inefficiency is crushing profit margins:

**The Daily Reality:**
- 6 AM: Plan routes manually on Google Maps while drinking coffee
- 7 AM: Driver calls - "Where's my next pickup?" - same question daily
- 9 AM: Customer calls: "Where's my package?" - spend 10 minutes tracking location
- 11 AM: Realize driver took wrong route - 45 minutes lost in traffic
- 2 PM: Another "Where's my package?" call - 15th today
- 5 PM: Still entering delivery confirmations and proof of delivery photos

**The Pain Points:**
- **Customer Service Overload**: 3 hours daily answering "Where's my package?" calls
- **Route Inefficiency**: â‚¬2,000/month lost on fuel and overtime from poor planning
- **Driver Communication Chaos**: Constant calls, texts, and confusion about priorities
- **Manual Tracking Systems**: Spreadsheets, paper forms, and lost delivery confirmations
- **Billing Nightmares**: Missing proof of delivery, disputed charges, delayed invoicing
- **Scale Limitations**: Can't grow beyond 5 drivers without hiring expensive dispatchers

**The Dream:**
A delivery business that runs itself - customers track their own packages, routes optimize automatically, drivers know exactly where to go next, and every delivery is perfectly documented and billed.
