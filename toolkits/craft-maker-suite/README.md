## üé® PERSONA: AISLING RYAN - POTTERY ARTIST

**Background:** Aisling creates beautiful ceramic pottery from her studio in West Cork. After completing her ceramics degree at NCAD Dublin, she's been crafting unique pieces for 8 years, selling at farmers markets, craft fairs, and online. Her pottery reflects the rugged beauty of the Irish coast.

**Current Challenges:**
- **Custom Order Chaos:** Verbal agreements forgotten, no deposit system, completion dates missed
- **Market Application Nightmare:** Applying to 20+ craft fairs annually with different requirements
- **Sales Channel Confusion:** Etsy, Instagram, markets, website all disconnected
- **Customer Search Frustration:** "Where can I buy your pottery?" - lost sales daily
- **Pricing Uncertainty:** Undercharging due to poor cost tracking
- **Inventory Blindness:** Don't know what sells where or when to restock

**Artisan Frustrations:**
- **Fair Applications:** Deadlines missed, booth fees forgotten, inventory planning chaos
- **Custom Orders:** No tracking system, customers forget discussions
- **Seasonal Slumps:** Winter market closure = income crash
- **Social Media Overload:** Instagram posts sporadic, no customer database

**Financial Impact:**
- **Lost Custom Orders:** ‚Ç¨1,200/month from poor tracking and communication
- **Missed Market Opportunities:** ‚Ç¨500/month from application failures
- **Underpricing:** ‚Ç¨300/month from insufficient cost analysis
