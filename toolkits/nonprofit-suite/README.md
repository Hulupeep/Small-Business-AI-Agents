## THE PERSONA: TOM MURPHY - COMMUNITY CONNECT DIRECTOR

Tom Murphy runs "Community Connect," a grassroots nonprofit in Limerick with 2 full-time staff and 50 volunteers, focused on youth programs, elderly support, and community events. Despite passion and dedication, operational chaos is limiting their impact:

**The Daily Reality:**
- 7 AM: Check volunteer WhatsApp groups - 3 people can't make today's elderly lunch program
- 9 AM: Grant application deadline in 2 days, still missing required documents
- 11 AM: Donor called asking for tax receipt from 6 months ago - can't find record
- 1 PM: Event planning meeting - half the volunteers forgot, others double-booked
- 4 PM: Board member asks for impact numbers for annual report - data scattered everywhere
- 7 PM: Still manually entering donation data from weekly church collection

**The Pain Points:**
- **Volunteer Coordination Nightmare**: 15 hours/week spent on scheduling, no-shows, and skill mismatches
- **Donor Relationship Gaps**: â‚¬3,000/month in lapsed donations due to poor follow-up
- **Event Management Chaos**: Last-minute scrambles, duplicate work, forgotten tasks
- **Grant Application Stress**: Missing deadlines, incomplete applications, poor tracking
- **Impact Measurement Struggle**: Can't demonstrate results to funders or community
- **Administrative Overload**: 25 hours/week on tasks that don't directly serve community

**The Dream:**
A nonprofit that runs efficiently - volunteers are engaged and coordinated, donors feel valued and connected, events execute flawlessly, and every euro maximizes community impact.
