### Phase 2: Integration (Week 2-3)
1. Connect to your CRM system (if supported)
2. Set up MLS data feed (if available)
3. Customize AI prompts for your market area
4. Train 1-2 team members on the system

### Phase 3: Production (Week 4)
1. Deploy to production environment
2. Start with 10-20 leads per day to test
3. Monitor results and adjust scoring criteria
4. Gradually increase usage as team gets comfortable

### Ongoing Maintenance
- Monthly prompt tuning: 2-3 hours
- Database maintenance: 1 hour/month
- Cost monitoring: 30 minutes/month
- Team support: 2-4 hours/month

## Success Metrics to Track
