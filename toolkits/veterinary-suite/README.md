## Who You Are
You're Dr. Sarah Mitchell, running Mitchell Veterinary Clinic with 2 other vets and 4 support staff. You see 40+ animals daily - routine checkups, emergencies, surgeries. You're drowning in appointment chaos, struggling with no-shows, chasing payment for expensive procedures, and managing after-hours emergencies. Pet owners constantly call asking "is this an emergency?" at 2am, and you're losing €2,000/month on missed appointments.

## Your Pain Points
- 📞 After-hours calls that aren't real emergencies (but some are!)
- 💔 No-shows costing you €2,000+/month
- 📋 Vaccine reminders falling through the cracks
- 💳 Chasing payments for expensive procedures
- 📱 Pet owners wanting updates during surgeries
- 📝 Handwritten records taking forever to update

## 🐾 5 Essential Veterinary AI Agents

### 1. **Appointment & Vaccine Manager**
*Smart scheduling that understands your practice*

**Core Features:**
- **Intelligent Scheduling**: Automatically accounts for species-specific needs (cats need quiet times, dogs avoid overlapping with loud procedures)
- **Vaccine Tracking**: Personalized reminder system based on pet age, breed, and local regulations
- **No-Show Prevention**: Predictive analytics identify at-risk appointments with automated confirmations
- **Multi-Pet Coordination**: Books entire families together, manages staggered appointments for nervous pets
- **Surgery Scheduling**: Integrates pre-op fasting instructions and post-op follow-up appointments

**Sample Workflow:**
```
🔔 "Luna (Golden Retriever, 8 weeks) is due for 2nd puppy vaccination"
📅 Auto-books 15-min slot avoiding busy surgery days
📱 Sends owner pre-visit checklist: "Bring previous vaccine record, list current diet"
⏰ 24hr confirmation call: "Any concerns since last visit?"
```

**Monthly Value:** €8,500 (reduced no-shows, optimized scheduling efficiency)

---

### 2. **After-Hours Triage System**
*Peace of mind for you, immediate help for pet owners*

**Emergency Assessment Protocol:**
- **Structured Questionnaire**: Guides owners through symptoms with vet-approved decision trees
- **Severity Scoring**:
  - 🚨 **Immediate** (bloat, seizures, breathing issues)
  - ⚠️ **Urgent** (vomiting, lethargy, limping)
  - 📞 **Can Wait** (mild cough, minor cuts)
- **Smart Routing**: Emergency cases → 24hr clinic, urgent → early morning slots, routine → standard booking
- **Documentation**: Complete case notes ready for morning handover

**Crisis Management:**
```
🌙 2:47 AM: "My dog ate chocolate"
🤖 System asks: Weight? Chocolate type? Amount? Time consumed?
📊 Risk assessment: "20kg dog, 50g milk chocolate = LOW RISK"
📱 Response: "Monitor for vomiting. Normal vet hours OK. Here's what to watch for..."
📝 Case logged for morning review
```

**Monthly Value:** €12,000 (reduced after-hours calls, improved emergency outcomes)

---

🔔 "Consider joint supplements, dietary consultation"
📈 "Breed predisposition: Hip dysplasia screening due"
📱 Owner notification: "Max's wellness check recommended"
```

**Monthly Value:** €15,000 (time savings, improved care quality, reduced errors)

---

### 4. **Client Communication Platform**
*Keep pet parents informed and engaged*

Day 3: "How is Luna settling in? Any questions about her vaccination?"
Day 30: "Luna's next vaccination reminder - book your appointment"
Day 365: "Luna's first birthday! Time for adult dog health planning"
```
