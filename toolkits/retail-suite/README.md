## Who You Are
You're Emma Thompson, owner of "Threads & Things" boutique on Shop Street. You carefully curate unique fashion pieces but struggle with online competition. Customers call asking "do you have this in size 12?" while you're serving someone else. Your Instagram takes hours weekly, loyalty cards get lost, and you're missing €4,000/month in sales because you can't quickly check stock or suggest alternatives.

## Your Pain Points
- 👗 "Do you have this in my size?" calls while serving customers
- 📱 Instagram posts taking 5+ hours weekly
- 💳 Paper loyalty cards constantly lost
- 🛍️ Can't compete with online stores' instant responses
- 📊 No idea which items drive repeat customers
- 🏃 Missing sales when customers leave without alternatives
