## THE PERSONA: RACHEL O'BRIEN - PREMIUM WEDDING PLANNER

Rachel O'Brien runs "Dream Day Events," a boutique wedding planning company in Cork handling 30+ weddings annually, with an average budget of â‚¬35,000. After 8 years building her reputation, she's struggling with operational overwhelm that's limiting growth:

**The Daily Reality:**
- 6 AM: Bride emails at midnight panicking about centerpiece height - 3rd crisis this week
- 8 AM: Vendor calls - florist overbooked for Saturday wedding, need emergency replacement
- 10 AM: Timeline meeting runs 2 hours because couple can't decide on processional music
- 1 PM: Mother-of-bride calls asking same question answered in last week's meeting notes
- 4 PM: Realize forgot to send final headcount to caterer - reception is in 3 days
- 8 PM: Still updating 5 different spreadsheets with vendor payments and timeline changes

**The Pain Points:**
- **Client Communication Chaos**: Brides calling at all hours, same questions asked repeatedly
- **Vendor Coordination Nightmare**: 15+ vendors per wedding, constant schedule changes and updates
- **Missing Revenue Opportunities**: â‚¬5,000/month in add-on services not offered or forgotten
- **Timeline Management Stress**: Last-minute changes cascade through entire vendor ecosystem
- **Administrative Overload**: 20 hours/week on spreadsheets instead of creative planning
- **Scale Limitations**: Can't take on more weddings without hiring expensive staff

**The Dream:**
A planning business that scales beautifully - clients feel completely cared for, vendors coordinate seamlessly, timelines update automatically, and Rachel can focus on creating magical moments instead of managing chaos.
