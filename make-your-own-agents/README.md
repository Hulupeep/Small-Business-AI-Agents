```
CONTEXT FOR AI:

- Prices: [wash $30, full groom $75]
- Hours: [Tue-Sat 9-6]
- Common questions: [shedding, matted fur, aggressive dogs]
```

### "The agent makes mistakes"
**Solution**: Add validation rules

- NEVER guarantee medical outcomes
- ALWAYS escalate complaints to human
```

### "It's too complicated"
**Solution**: Start smaller
```
Let's start simple:
Build ONLY an FAQ bot that answers these 10 questions:

[... list your top 10 questions]

We'll add features later.
